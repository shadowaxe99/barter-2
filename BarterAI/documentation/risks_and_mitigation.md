# Risks & Mitigation

This document outlines the potential risks associated with the BarterAI project and the strategies we have in place to mitigate these risks.

## Risk: Users disagree with AI's fairness assessment

Despite our best efforts to create a fair and equitable AI matchmaking engine, there is a risk that users may disagree with the AI's fairness assessment. This could lead to dissatisfaction and loss of trust in the platform.

### Mitigation

To mitigate this risk, we have implemented a robust feedback system. This system allows users to provide feedback on the AI's match suggestions, which the AI can then use to improve future match suggestions. This continuous learning process will help the AI to better understand user preferences and make more accurate and fair match suggestions over time.

## Risk: Security breaches or data leaks

As with any platform that handles user data, there is a risk of security breaches or data leaks. This could lead to loss of user trust, legal issues, and damage to the platform's reputation.

### Mitigation

To mitigate this risk, we employ state-of-the-art security measures. This includes regular security audits, data encryption, and secure cloud storage for user data, item listings, and images. We also have a secure trade confirmation process in place to prevent fraud. Furthermore, we are committed to ensuring user data privacy and GDPR compliance.
