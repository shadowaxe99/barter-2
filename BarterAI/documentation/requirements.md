# BarterAI Requirements

BarterAI is a cutting-edge bartering platform that uses artificial intelligence to pair users based on their listed items and desired exchanges. The AI ensures that matches are fair, preventing rip-offs and significantly reducing the time users spend searching for the right trade.

## Objectives

- Enhance user experience by providing automated, fair match suggestions.
- Increase trust within the platform by ensuring equitable trades.
- Reduce time spent on manual searches and negotiations.

## Features and Requirements

  - **User Preference Learning**: Understand user preferences and past trades to refine suggestions over time.
  - **Fairness Assessment**: Ensure both parties benefit equally from a trade.

### User Profile & Listings

- **Description**: Users can create profiles and list items they wish to barter.
  - **Upload Items**: Users can add photos, descriptions, and desired exchanges for each item.
  - **Trade History**: View past trades and feedback from other users.
  - **Wishlist**: Users can list items they're seeking, aiding the AI in finding matches.

### Trade Interface

- **Description**: Once a match is suggested, users can negotiate, finalize, and review trades.
  - **Chat & Negotiation**: Built-in messaging for users to discuss trades.
  - **Trade Confirmation**: Secure process to finalize the barter.
  - **Feedback & Rating**: After a trade, users can leave feedback and rate their experience.

### AI Feedback Mechanism

- **Description**: Users can provide feedback on AI match suggestions, helping refine the AI's accuracy.
  - **Match Satisfaction Check**: Post-trade surveys assessing user satisfaction with AI's match.
  - **Continuous Learning**: The AI will use feedback to improve future match suggestions.

## User Flow

1. User registers and sets up a profile.
2. User lists items for barter and sets desired exchanges or creates a wishlist.
3. The AI analyzes the platform and suggests potential trades.
4. Users receive match notifications and can then chat/negotiate.
5. Once both parties agree, they confirm the trade.
6. After the trade, users leave feedback and rate their experience.

## Technical Requirements

- Robust AI model trained on item values, historical trades, and user feedback.
- Secure cloud storage for user data, item listings, and images.
