# BarterAI User Flow

This document outlines the user flow for the BarterAI platform. The flow is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, guiding users through the process of setting up a profile, listing items, receiving match suggestions, negotiating trades, and providing feedback.

## 1. User Registration and Profile Setup

Users start by registering on the platform. They provide necessary details such as username, email, and password. After successful registration, they are directed to set up their profile. The profile setup includes adding personal details and preferences.

```python
# src/user.py
def register_user(username, email, password):
    # Registration logic here

def setup_profile(user_id, details):
    # Profile setup logic here
```

## 2. Listing Items for Barter

Once the profile is set up, users can list items they wish to barter. They can add photos, descriptions, and desired exchanges for each item. They can also create a wishlist of items they are seeking.

```python
# src/user_profile_and_listings/upload_items.py
def upload_item(user_id, item_details):
    # Item upload logic here

# src/user_profile_and_listings/wishlist.py
def create_wishlist(user_id, wishlist_items):
    # Wishlist creation logic here
```

## 3. AI Match Suggestions

The AI analyzes the platform and suggests potential trades based on user listings and preferences. Users receive notifications when a match is found.

```python
# src/ai_matchmaking_engine/item_analysis.py
# src/ai_matchmaking_engine/user_preference_learning.py
# src/ai_matchmaking_engine/fairness_assessment.py
def suggest_matches(user_id):
    # Match suggestion logic here
```

## 4. Chat and Negotiation

Users can chat and negotiate with their match using the built-in messaging system.

```python
# src/trade_interface/chat_and_negotiation.py
def start_chat(user_id_1, user_id_2):
    # Chat initiation logic here
```

## 5. Trade Confirmation

Once both parties agree on the trade, they confirm it through a secure process.

```python
# src/trade_interface/trade_confirmation.py
def confirm_trade(trade_id):
    # Trade confirmation logic here
```

## 6. Feedback and Rating

After the trade, users can leave feedback and rate their experience. This feedback is used to improve the AI's match suggestions.

```python
# src/trade_interface/feedback_and_rating.py
def leave_feedback(user_id, trade_id, rating, comments):
    # Feedback submission logic here

# src/ai_feedback_mechanism/continuous_learning.py
def learn_from_feedback(feedback_id):
    # AI learning logic here
```

This user flow ensures a smooth and intuitive experience for users while also providing valuable data for the AI to learn and improve.
